# PetersGameEngine
A game engine programmed in C++. This engine will have support for life updating of game code, life loop editing and a whole lot more.
The infrastructure of the engine (platform and game code layers) is greatly inspired by the design by [Casey Muratori](http://mollyrocket.com/casey/about.html) from [Molly Rocket](http://mollyrocket.com/about.html) who also works on Jonathan Blow's next game "The Witness". He does a stream called Handmade Hero where he architects a game engine from scratch without any libraries. So credit to him for inspiring me.
The engine will have the following features:
* Live code reloading
* Life loop editing
* Audio (Direct Sound)
* Xbox compatible controller and keyboard support (XInput)
* OpenGL (at some later point in time) and shader support
* 3D (OpenGL)
* *.obj importer
* *.fbx importer

(more to be anounced as the project follows on)
